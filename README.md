## 📖 Introduction  
We present **Elastic Federated Learning (EFL)** for O-RAN environments, enabling concurrent execution of multiple distributed learning tasks. Our framework integrates O-RAN’s RIC (RAN Intelligent Controller) architecture with federated learning mechanisms to optimize:  
- Multi-FL service resource allocation  
- Latency-aware scheduling  
- Dynamic adaptation to heterogeneous clients  

This implementation is intended for research and reproducibility of our results.
